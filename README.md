## Project Overview

### Welcome to the Small Business and Vendor Connection Website!

This project is a web platform designed to bridge the gap between small businesses, vendors, hawkers, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and disabled individuals and the customers who are still passionate about shopping from local vendors. It's a place where these groups can connect, collaborate, and thrive together. This README provides an overview of the project.
